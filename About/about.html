	<p id = "column-11">Hi, my name is <strong>Ji-hern Baek</strong>. I am currently studying at the University of California, Berkeley, as a 4th year Cognitive Science Major and Computer Science Minor. I am passionate about design, technology, and people; and I work to find the balance between those three.</p>
	<p id = "column-12">Accordingly, I am an aspiring UI/UX designer; I believe such a career allows me to work at the crossing paths between design, technological development and integration, and human growth.</p>
	<p id = "column-21">Aside from design work, I enjoy being involved in a variety of communities. I recently served as the President of Cal's Korean American Student Association. Additionally, I currently serve as the Chief of Staff for a university senator, reside as an appointed member of Cal's Mental Health Wellness Committee, and am involved in Berkeley Innovation and Innovative Design - two of Cal's design organizations.</p>
	<p id = "column-22">I also enjoy hiking and <a target="_blank" href="https://youtube.com/baekversion">singing</a> (check out the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/artistsinresonanceacappella?fref=ts">a cappella group</a> I was a part of)!</p>
